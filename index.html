<!--
This site is a mobile-first design using several tabs in one load, it means the
users load the site once and clicking through to other "pages" (actually tabs)
is much quicker.

Any tabs with hand-written copy in them will be in this file. Any tabs which generate
their contents based on online data sources (typically google spreadsheets) will
load their information via the corresponding .js files in the background once the
core HTML has loaded.

The navigation is in two parts: a main navigation bar, which is the same everywhere
 and a tab-specific sub-navigation bar underneath. Any tabs that need to use
 sub-navigation build their own using javascript when their tab is shown and This
 navigation is kept at the top of the page using "sticky" javascript (not an
 industry-wide term, we just call it that here).

Since this is a mobile-first design it's important to consider phone screen space
when adding new elements (e.g. to navigation bars) and since this is all in one
page, css styles and div ids used for javascript should use tab-specific naming

        <h4>Covid-19: will the 2020 Fair go ahead?</h4>
        <p>We are working on the basis that it will, but are also making alternative plans in case government restrictions for large gatherings remain in place. Please look out for updates here on our website.
However, regardless of the virus, the forthcoming launch of a new charity - <b>Love Mill Road</b> - will bring an opportunity for an inspiring community project to celebrate Mill Road's distinctive identity and culture. We plan to work with local organisations, artists and volunteers to develop the project, which will be at the heart of this year's Mill Road Winter Fair. Please do get in touch via <a href="mailto:volunteers@millroadwinterfair.org">volunteers@millroadwinterfair.org</a> if you would like to get involved.

        <h4>About the fair</h4>
        <p>Every year, on the first Saturday in December, Mill Road is transformed. People take over from cars, shopkeepers turn out and set up their stalls, and we provide spaces for local businesses and charities to sell crafts, gifts and refreshments all along the street. Interspersed with the stalls are buskers, circus performers, dancers, poets and storytellers to entertain and inspire.</p>
        <p>The Winter Fair is run entirely by volunteers and we need your donations to help stage it every year. If you would like to get involved or donate we would very much appreciate it.</p>

      <h4>MILL ROAD WINTER FAIR AGM</h4>
      <p>Given the constraints generated by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, we decided to cancel our Mill Road Winter Fair AGM and instead to carry out essential processes online.</p>

      <h4>Donations</h4>
      <p>We rely on donations to pay for the road closure and essential infrastructure that is required to ensure a safe and efficient fair. We are looking for sponsorship from local businesses so please consider whether you can support us.</p>
      <p>Individuals can help by becoming a ‘Friend of the Fair’. Please email <a href="mailto:treasurer@millroadwinterfair.org">treasurer@millroadwinterfair.org</a> if you're interested.</p>
      <p>The fair does not have charitable status, but will work closely with a new charity, Love Mill Road, which is evolving from
 the Suzy Oakes Trust and aims to sustain a thriving Mill Road community. Any profits from the fair will be transferred to Love Mill Road and donations to Love Mill Road will help to fund the fair, as well as the activities and projects of other Mill Road charities and community organisations.</p>
      <p>There will be collection buckets on the day, please give generously. Personal donations can also be made online.</p>
      <p>However you choose to do so, your donations mean so very much to us and we'd gladly accept anything you can spare to keep this wonderful fair going.</p>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="committee" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="committee-tab">
      <h3>The Committee</h3>
      <h4>What we do</h4>
      <p>The Mill Road Winter Fair Committee are the volunteers who plan the rough outlines of the fair. They arrange the road closure, bring in volunteer stewards, book marquees, organise the parade, negotiate stall venues, event venues, busking spots etc. and put out publicity so people know what's going on and all the other details that go with that.</p>
      <p>We endeavour to make every reasonable effort to ensure that our direct activities, and those that we manage, are organised in a safe manner and to ensure the safety of those participating in and attending the event. However, all attendees, participants, traders, workers and volunteers have a responsibility for their own safety and those around them and remain responsible for their own actions. Stalls that were arranged via the committee can be identified by official trader certificates issued by the Mill Road Winter Fair Committee.</p>

      <h4>What other people do</h4>
      <p>Other activities, including those at indoor venues, Perowne St, Hope St Yard and many of the stalls directly outside local shops, are not organised or managed by us. We think that's fantastic. They are part of why we love Mill Road as much as we do and we'll try to list their activities on this site as well so you don't miss them.</p>
      <p>It does mean, however, that when it comes to these other activities we and our contractors accept no liability for any accident or loss, whether direct or indirect. The organisers of those individual activities, rather than the Committee, will be responsible for the safety of their own activities at all times.</p>
      <p>Nor do we accept any credit for how great they are. We very much encourage you to check them out on the day!</p>

      <h3>Mill Road Lanterns</h3>
      <h4>A Spotlight on our distinctive community</h4>
      <p>With the latest news about the Covid Emergency Road Scheme, Mill Road and its special community spirit will be much in people's minds. We don't yet know if the Mill Road Winter Fair (MRWF) will go ahead in its usual form this year; the MRWF Committee will make a decision by 1st September, the date when we would need to open the online stalls application process. However, in the meantime we are planning an inspiring new community project, which can take place even if the Fair can't and which will be funded by a new charity, Love Mill Road.</p>
      <p><b>Love Mill Road</b> has grown from the Fair and from the legacy of the Suzy Oakes Trust. It has been established to provide a way to channel sponsorship and donations to local Mill Road community projects, including the non-commercial aspects of the MRWF. As a charity, it can benefit from Gift Aid and will help to ensure the long-term sustainability and community focus of the Fair while also supporting community projects throughout the year, including (currently under discussion) a Repair Caf&eacute; at the Edge, support for Jimmys' 25 year celebrations and a series of Mill Road Fringe events.</p>
      <p><b>Mill Road Lanterns</b> will be organised and led by the MRWF Committee and funded by Love Mill Road. It will celebrate the identity and culture of Mill Road, highlighting the diversity, history and independence of its community. We will cast a spotlight on the stories of some of Mill Road's inspiring personalities, community projects, shopkeepers, buildings and history, pairing narratives and performances in the Mill Road buildings and online with a street-side light show. We are planning that a new 'story' will be added each day in the fortnight leading up to Saturday 5<sup>th</sup> December, the date set for the 2020 Mill Road Winter Fair.</p>
      <p>The project is evolving and we recognise that the plans outlined here are likely to change. The MRWF Committee is keen to work with other organisations (eg. the Mill Road Traders' Association, Mill Road Bridges, Makespace and the Mill Road History Group) to develop the ideas. Funding depends on donations to Love Mill Road, from local residents and businesses and there will be publisicty, with a call for donations, during August.</p>
      <p>So far we have the following preliminary plans for the Mill Road Lanterns project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mill Road personalities are interviewed by volunteers and their stories written up as a series of short articles.</li>
        <li>The stories provide inspiration for creative projects - video performances of music, poetry and dance or artworks by local artists - which will be made available online.</li>
        <li>Participating shops and buildings recieve a decorated Mill Road Lantern, which is hung in a prominent window so that it is visible from Mill Road. Ideally each lantern will be an individually designed piece, inspired by the story associated with the place where it is to be displayed. The shops/organisations that receive a lantern will be encouraged to keep it for future display so that the project builds year-on-year.</li>
        <li>There will be a step-by-step 'release' of the stories and creative projects during the fortnight before the Fair date; one will go live each day and the moment will be celebrated with a colourful projected light display which will illuminate the featured shop/buildings for one evening only. There may be scope for shadow puppets and the light display would ideally reflect the story that is connected with the place.</li>
        <li>Images from the display will be captured and used online and in the local media, alongside the story and featured video performances/artworks.</li>
        <li>There might also be a treasure hunt or curiosity trail which encourages people to explore Mill Road, following clues to solve in association with the lanterns along the street.</li>
        <li>On the 5<sup>th</sup> December, all the lanterns will be 'lit' and there may also be scope for a celebratory display of laser beams along the street.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Mill Road Lanterns project would bring together and use expertise from many volunteers and local organisations. It can be done with social distancing, is flexible and would be very media-friendly.</p>
      <p>NOTE - The project cannot promote the commercial aspects of local shops and businesses as Love Mill Road can only support community projects that meet its charitable objectives. However, there would be obvious indirect benefits for the local Mill Road economy.</p>

      <h4>Please get in touch to get involved</h4>
      <p>Mill Road Lanterns will rely on involvement from many people and we would be thrilled to hear from anyone who would like to help. We hope that these outline plans will be shaped by the ideas and skills of all the participants.</p>
      <p>Please get in touch if you would like to help us to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>develop the mill Road stories</b> - interviews, research, writing and community engagement</li>
        <li><b>coordinate the creative stuff</b> - video performances/artworks, which would 'go live' during November</li>
        <li><b>work with our IT manager</b> - to make this happen on our website</li>
        <li><b>manage our PR and Communications</b> - we are looking for someone to lead on this key role for the MRWF Committee (a fantastic opportunity for someone who is looking to launch their career in this field)</li>
        <li><b>make the Mill Road Lanterns</b> - we are hoping to inspire creative crafters and makers who have the skills to create a set of simple decorative lanterns - ideally each would be individually designed but we are thinking that there would be a template to work from. Perhaps laser-cut steel?</li>
        <li><b>create the colourful projected light displays</b> tailored to express the story and character of each of the selected shops/buildings</li>
        <li><b>design the way it looks</b> - graphic design for our website and publicity</li>
        <li><b>photograph</b> the participants, light displays and lanterns</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Project manager</b> - we are also seeking someone to manage the projet, which would involve coordinaing the volunteers, participants, performers and makers. If this could be you, please contact <a href="mailto:chair@millroadwinterfair.org">Kate</a> as below.</p>
      <p><b>Please also feel free to suggest for further roles</b> - if reading this has sparked any further aspects/additional elements that you might have skills to contribute</p>
      <p>We are looking for volunteers, but hope to be able to pay costs and would make a point of publicising and crediting the work of the volunteers and organisations we work with.</p>
      <p>Just email Kate - <a href="mailto:chair@millroadwinterfair.org">chair@millroadwinterfair.org</a> to find out more.</p>

<!--
This site is a mobile-first design using several tabs in one load, it means the
users load the site once and clicking through to other "pages" (actually tabs)
is much quicker.

Any tabs with hand-written copy in them will be in this file. Any tabs which generate
their contents based on online data sources (typically google spreadsheets) will
load their information via the corresponding .js files in the background once the
core HTML has loaded.

The navigation is in two parts: a main navigation bar, which is the same everywhere
 and a tab-specific sub-navigation bar underneath. Any tabs that need to use
 sub-navigation build their own using javascript when their tab is shown and This
 navigation is kept at the top of the page using "sticky" javascript (not an
 industry-wide term, we just call it that here).

Since this is a mobile-first design it's important to consider phone screen space
when adding new elements (e.g. to navigation bars) and since this is all in one
page, css styles and div ids used for javascript should use tab-specific naming

      <h4>Donations</h4>
      <p>We rely on donations to pay for the road closure and essential infrastructure that is required to ensure a safe and efficient fair. We are looking for sponsorship from local businesses so please consider whether you can support us.</p>
      <p>Individuals can help by becoming a ‘Friend of the Fair’. Please email <a href="mailto:treasurer@millroadwinterfair.org">treasurer@millroadwinterfair.org</a> if you're interested.</p>
      <p>The fair does not have charitable status, but will work closely with a new charity, Love Mill Road, which is evolving from
 the Suzy Oakes Trust and aims to sustain a thriving Mill Road community. Any profits from the fair will be transferred to Love Mill Road and donations to Love Mill Road will help to fund the fair, as well as the activities and projects of other Mill Road charities and community organisations.</p>
      <p>There will be collection buckets on the day, please give generously. Personal donations can also be made online.</p>
      <p>However you choose to do so, your donations mean so very much to us and we'd gladly accept anything you can spare to keep this wonderful fair going.</p>

      <p>On the day most of the committee will be out and about on Mill Road.

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="committee" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="committee-tab">
      <h3>The Committee</h3>
      <h4>What we do</h4>
      <p>The Mill Road Winter Fair Committee are the volunteers who plan the rough outlines of the fair. They arrange the road closure, bring in volunteer stewards, book marquees, organise the parade, negotiate stall venues, event venues, busking spots etc. and put out publicity so people know what's going on and all the other details that go with that.</p>
      <p>We endeavour to make every reasonable effort to ensure that our direct activities, and those that we manage, are organised in a safe manner and to ensure the safety of those participating in and attending the event. However, all attendees, participants, traders, workers and volunteers have a responsibility for their own safety and those around them and remain responsible for their own actions. Stalls that were arranged via the committee can be identified by official trader certificates issued by the Mill Road Winter Fair Committee.</p>

      <h4>What other people do</h4>
      <p>Other activities, including those at indoor venues, Perowne St, Hope St Yard and many of the stalls directly outside local shops, are not organised or managed by us. We think that's fantastic. They are part of why we love Mill Road as much as we do and we'll try to list their activities on this site as well so you don't miss them.</p>
      <p>It does mean, however, that when it comes to these other activities we and our contractors accept no liability for any accident or loss, whether direct or indirect. The organisers of those individual activities, rather than the Committee, will be responsible for the safety of their own activities at all times.</p>
      <p>Nor do we accept any credit for how great they are. We very much encourage you to check them out on the day!</p>
